From 2011 to 2016, the return stays around 0%. Beginning 2017, the return has an initial slight increase, but then begins to exponentially increase after that. By 2021, the return values hit a peak of about 15,000%. Despite waiting many years, our strategy, which is simply one of infinitely many, has evidently succeeded. However, as demonstrated by the chaotic growth of our strategy, the stock price is volatile, making accurate forcasting of future returns near impossible.
